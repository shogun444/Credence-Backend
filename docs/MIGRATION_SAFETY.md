# Migration Safety Guide

This guide provides best practices and safe patterns for database migrations in the Credence backend.

## Overview

The migration system includes built-in guardrails to prevent potentially dangerous operations and ensure smooth deployments. These include:

- **Preflight checks** that analyze migrations before execution
- **Runtime safeguards** that block unsafe operations
- **Online schema change patterns** for zero-downtime deployments
- **Comprehensive guardrails** for long-running operations, batching, and rollback procedures

## Enhanced Guardrails

For comprehensive migration guardrails including batching strategies, lock timeout management, and rollback procedures, see:

- **[Migration Guardrails Guide](./MIGRATION_GUARDRAILS.md)** - Complete guide for long-running schema changes
- **[Batching Utilities](../src/migrations/utils/batching.ts)** - Safe batch operations
- **[Lock Timeout Management](../src/migrations/utils/lock-timeout.ts)** - Lock safety and timeout configuration
- **[Rollback Checklist](../src/migrations/utils/rollback-checklist.ts)** - Comprehensive rollback procedures

## Previewing Migrations with Dry-Run

Before executing migrations, you can preview the SQL changes using the dry-run command:

```bash
npm run migrate:dry-run
```

This command shows:

- The SQL statements that would be executed
- Which migrations would be applied
- The order of execution

The dry-run command is useful for:

- **Code review**: Share the SQL changes with the team before deployment
- **Impact analysis**: Understand what changes will be made to the database
- **Planning**: Verify migrations work as expected without risking production data
- **Documentation**: Keep a record of what schema changes are being deployed

**Note**: The dry-run command still requires a valid DATABASE_URL but does not modify any data.

## Safe Migration Patterns

### 1. Adding Columns

**❌ Unsafe:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
```

**✅ Safe:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Add nullable column
pgm.addColumn("users", "email", {
  type: "varchar(255)",
  null: true,
  comment: "Added for email feature - will be NOT NULL after backfill",
});

// Step 2: Backfill data in application code or separate migration
// Step 3: Add NOT NULL constraint in follow-up migration
pgm.alterColumn("users", "email", { notNull: true });
```

### 2. Creating Indexes

**❌ Unsafe (blocks writes):**

```typescript
pgm.createIndex("large_table", "column_name");
```

**✅ Safe (online):**

```typescript
pgm.createIndex("large_table", "column_name", {
  method: "CONCURRENTLY",
  name: "idx_large_table_column",
});
```

### 3. Column Replacement

When replacing a column, use a multi-step approach:

```typescript
// Migration 1: Add new column
export async function up(pgm: MigrationBuilder): Promise<void> {
  pgm.addColumn("users", "new_status", {
    type: "varchar(50)",
    null: true,
    comment: "Replacing old_status field",
  });

  // Create index on new column
  pgm.createIndex("users", "new_status", { method: "CONCURRENTLY" });
}

// Migration 2: Backfill data
export async function up(pgm: MigrationBuilder): Promise<void> {
  // Backfill data from old column to new column
  pgm.sql(`
    UPDATE users 
    SET new_status = old_status 
    WHERE new_status IS NULL
  `);
}

// Migration 3: Switch references and drop old column
export async function up(pgm: MigrationBuilder): Promise<void> {
  // Add NOT NULL constraint to new column
  pgm.alterColumn("users", "new_status", { notNull: true });

  // Update application code to use new column

  // Drop old column (after verifying app works with new column)
  pgm.dropColumn("users", "old_status");

  // Rename new column if needed
  pgm.renameColumn("users", "new_status", "status");
}
```

### 4. Large Data Updates

**❌ Unsafe (locks table):**

```typescript
pgm.sql('UPDATE large_table SET status = "active" WHERE condition = true');
```

**✅ Safe (batched):**

```typescript
// Use application-level batching or pg-batch
// Or create a separate backfill script that runs in batches
pgm.sql(`
  UPDATE large_table 
  SET status = 'active' 
  WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM large_table 
    WHERE condition = true 
    LIMIT 1000
  )
`);
```

## Migration Guardrails

### Preflight Checks

The system automatically checks for:

- **Blocking operations**: ADD COLUMN NOT NULL, CREATE UNIQUE INDEX, etc.
- **Long-running operations**: Large UPDATEs/DELETEs, index creation
- **Unsafe operations**: DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, etc.

### Runtime Safeguards

- Automatic detection of potentially blocking operations
- Warnings for operations that might cause replication lag
- Enforcement of rollback strategies

## Using the Migration Linter

### Check all migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate:lint
```

### Check specific migration:

```bash
npm run migrate:lint -- --file migrations/001_add_email.ts
```

### Strict mode (warnings as errors):

```bash
npm run migrate:lint -- --strict
```

### Pre-flight check:

```bash
npm run migrate:preflight -- --file migrations/001_add_email.ts
```

## Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Staging Environment

Always test migrations in a staging environment with production-like data size.

### 2. Migration Timing

- Run potentially long-running migrations during low-traffic periods
- Use `CONCURRENTLY` for index creation on large tables
- Monitor database performance during migrations

### 3. Rollback Strategy

Every migration must have a working `down()` function that:

- Completely reverses the `up()` changes
- Handles edge cases (like partially completed operations)
- Has been tested in staging

### 4. Monitoring

- Monitor database locks during migration execution
- Watch replication lag in database clusters
- Set up alerts for long-running migrations

## Migration Checklist

Before creating a migration:

- [ ] Understand the impact on the application
- [ ] Have a rollback strategy
- [ ] Test with production-like data
- [ ] Consider online schema change patterns
- [ ] Add proper documentation

Before deploying:

- [ ] Run migration linter: `npm run migrate:lint -- --strict`
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Verify rollback works
- [ ] Plan deployment timing
- [ ] Prepare monitoring

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Adding NOT NULL columns without defaults

**Problem**: Blocks writes to the table
**Solution**: Add as NULL, backfill, then add constraint

### 2. Creating unique indexes on large tables

**Problem**: Blocks writes and can take hours
**Solution**: Use CONCURRENTLY or create non-unique index first

### 3. Large UPDATE/DELETE operations

**Problem**: Locks rows and causes replication lag
**Solution**: Use batching or application-level backfill

### 4. Missing rollback functions

**Problem**: Cannot easily undo changes
**Solution**: Always implement and test `down()` functions

## Emergency Procedures

If a migration fails:

1. **Stop the migration process**
2. **Check database locks**: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted`
3. **Review error logs** for specific failure reason
4. **Run rollback** if safe: `npm run migrate:down`
5. **Contact database team** for complex issues

## Tools and Commands

```bash
# Create new migration with safety template
npm run migrate:create -- --name add_user_email --online

# Check migration safety
npm run migrate:lint

# Run pre-flight checks
npm run migrate:preflight -- --file migrations/001_add_email.ts

# Preview migrations (dry-run) without executing
npm run migrate:dry-run

# Run migration with safety checks
npm run migrate:up

# Run migration allowing blocking ops (emergency only)
npm run migrate:up -- --allow-blocking

# Skip safety checks (emergency only)
npm run migrate:up -- --skip-preflight
```
