# Webhook Notifications

Webhook system for delivering bond lifecycle events to registered endpoints.

## Events

- `bond.created` - Bond becomes active
- `bond.slashed` - Bond amount decreases while active
- `bond.withdrawn` - Bond becomes inactive with zero amount

## Payload Format

```json
{
  "event": "bond.created",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "address": "0xabc...",
    "bondedAmount": "1000",
    "bondStart": 1234567890,
    "bondDuration": 86400,
    "active": true
  }
}
```

## Security

Payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256. Verify using the `X-Webhook-Signature` header:

```typescript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto'

const signature = createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(requestBody)
  .digest('hex')

if (signature !== request.headers['x-webhook-signature']) {
  throw new Error('Invalid signature')
}
```

## Mutual TLS (mTLS) Support

For enterprise subscribers requiring mutual TLS authentication, webhooks can be configured with client certificates and server certificate pinning.

### Configuration

The webhook configuration supports optional mTLS fields:

- `clientCertPem` - PEM-encoded client certificate for mTLS authentication
- `clientKeyKmsRef` - KMS reference for client private key (never stored as plaintext)
- `pinnedServerCertSha256` - SHA256 hash of pinned server certificate for certificate pinning

### Certificate Rotation

Client certificates can be rotated by updating the `clientCertPem` and `clientKeyKmsRef` fields. The system supports:

- Grace period for certificate rotation (24 hours by default)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff on temporary certificate issues
- Certificate pinning validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

### Error Handling

mTLS-specific failures emit the `WEBHOOK_MTLS_FAILURE` error code and are tracked via the `webhook_mtls_failure_total` metric with labels:
- `subscriber` - webhook ID
- `reason` - specific failure reason (e.g., `cert_pin_mismatch`, `handshake_failure`)

### Security Best Practices

1. **Client Key Storage**: Client private keys are stored only as KMS references, never in plaintext
2. **Certificate Pinning**: Server certificate hashes are compared in constant time to prevent timing attacks
3. **Rotation Support**: Certificate rotation is supported with a grace period to avoid service disruption
4. **Fail-Safe**: mTLS configuration is optional; webhooks without mTLS continue to work with standard HTTPS

## Delivery

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts, configurable per webhook)
- 5 second timeout per request (configurable per webhook)
- Rate limited to 1 delivery per webhook per 100ms
- 4xx errors are not retried
- mTLS handshake failures emit specific error codes for debugging

## Usage

```typescript
import { createWebhookService } from './services/webhooks/index.js'

// Create service with webhook store and postgres DLQ store
const dlqStore = new PostgresDlqStore(pool)
const webhookService = new WebhookService(store, {
  maxRetries: 3,
  initialDelay: 1000,
  timeout: 5000,
}, dlqStore)

// Emit event
await webhookService.emit('bond.created', {
  address: '0xabc',
  bondedAmount: '1000',
  bondStart: 1234567890,
  bondDuration: 86400,
  active: true,
})
```

### mTLS Configuration Example

```typescript
// Configure webhook with mTLS
await webhookService.register({
  url: 'https://enterprise.example.com/webhook',
  events: ['bond.created', 'bond.slashed'],
  secret: 'hmac-signing-secret',
  clientCertPem: '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...',
  clientKeyKmsRef: 'kms://arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abc123',
  pinnedServerCertSha256: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6...',
  timeoutMs: 10000,
  maxAttempts: 5,
})
```

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Failed webhook deliveries (e.g. max retries exceeded or 4xx responses) are permanently stored in a Postgres-backed Dead Letter Queue (`webhook_dlq` table).

- **Durability**: Survives application restarts and deployments.
- **Metrics**: The current size of the DLQ is exposed as a Prometheus gauge `webhook_dlq_size`.
- **Replayability**: DLQ entries can be inspected and manually replayed, updating the `replayed_at` timestamp.
- **mTLS Failures**: mTLS-specific failures include the `WEBHOOK_MTLS_FAILURE` error code for identification.

## Integration

Integrate with identity state sync:

```typescript
import { emitWebhookForStateChange } from './listeners/webhookIntegration.js'

// After updating state
const oldState = await store.get(address)
await store.set(newState)
await emitWebhookForStateChange(webhookService, oldState, newState)
```

## Monitoring

Key metrics for webhook delivery:

- `webhook_delivery_duration` - Time taken for webhook delivery attempts
- `webhook_timeout_total` - Count of webhook timeouts
- `webhook_mtls_failure_total` - Count of mTLS-specific failures (with `subscriber` and `reason` labels)
- `webhook_dlq_size` - Current size of the dead letter queue
